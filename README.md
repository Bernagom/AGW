# AGW
MODEL and utilities for AGW generation and propgation over rigid and elastic bottom, generated by surface or bottom sources

This software package has been created to host tools for AGW modeling system using MATLAB. This
package has been developed and tested on MATLAB v2019 or higher.

Installation  : To install the agw_tools to your local system, including all the required binary 
                files, run on your Matlab console:   
                `cd AGW`   
                `setup_agw`  
                
                It will take some time, depending on your internet connection, but the gridgen will
                be added to your local path and the binary files will be downloaded automatically.
                
                Dependency    : Matlab and netcdf routines for matlab. 
                Netcdf toolbox for Matlab can be obtained from (http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/)
                (NOTE: Netcdf toolbox is only used for reading the global bathymetry data files
                If you have your own independent set of routines for reading netcdf files then 
                only a few lines need to be changed in the 'generate_grid.m' routine. These lines
                have been marked)
                
                Files         :  There are 3 sub-directories
                   bin/            -- this stores all the scripts used in the grid generation routine
                   examples/       -- 
                   reference_data/ -- this stores all the reference data that is needed for the package
                                      and includes two global grids, GSHHS shoreline polygon database and 
                                      an optional user defined polygon database (combined with a flag file
                                      that determines which of these polygons are to be used) for masking
                                      out water bodies that do not play a critical role in wave propagation
